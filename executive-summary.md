# Executive Summary

*The Compliance-First MCP Gateway for US Regulated Industries*

---

## The Problem

US enterprises deploying Model Context Protocol (MCP) face an impossible choice: risk regulatory violations or fall behind on AI innovation. With 281 companies flagging AI as material risk (473% increase YoY) and breach costs averaging $4.88M nationally ($10.93M in healthcare), organizations desperately need compliant MCP governance.

## The Solution

Giru.ai provides the only MCP gateway with **pre-configured compliance blueprints** for SOC2, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Built on CNCF-graduated projects (Envoy + OPA), we reduce deployment from 6 months to 1 week while ensuring regulatory compliance.

### Key Differentiators:

- ✅ **One-click compliance packages** (vs months of configuration)
- ✅ **Industry-specific blueprints** (healthcare, finance, retail)
- ✅ **Multi-layer US compliance** (federal + 50 states + industry)
- ✅ **Automated audit reports** (examination-ready)
